# This script takes care of:
# 1. Updating the version numbers across the project
# 2. Update requirements and their files across the project
# 3. Generating a new changelog based on the commit history
# 4. Committing the changes to the git repository
# 5. Creating a new tag for the release
# 6. Building the package
# 7. Publishing the package to PyPI

# It is incompatible with pre-release versions for simplicity.

# This script requires both Poetry and git to be installed and configured on the system,
# including authentication for pushing to the remote repository and publishing to PyPI.
